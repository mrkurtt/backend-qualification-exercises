# Downtime Logs
Create a utility function that merges the downtime logs pulled from multiple sources. The function should take in a list of downtime logs and merge them into a single set of downtime logs. Each set of downtime logs is represented as a list of tuples where each tuple represents a downtime period. The tuple contains two elements, the start time and the end time of the downtime period.
